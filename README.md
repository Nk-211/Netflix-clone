# Netflix-clone
A responsive Netflix-inspired web application built using React and modern CSS. The project focuses on component-based architecture, dynamic UI rendering, and clean layout design to replicate the core look and feel of the Netflix platform. It helped strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, reusable components, and frontend best practices.
